# Research_Of_Coding_Alghoritms

This repository contains the project “Research of Coding Algorithms” within the subject Linear Algebra. The three of us worked on it, me, Roman Zaletskyi (https://github.com/Romko-studik), and Maksym Kutsenko (https://github.com/maxonchickdev).

The methods we implemented: Huffman coding, BCH, LRC, and the convolution method.

The results of these encodings are presented in the file Report.pdf.
