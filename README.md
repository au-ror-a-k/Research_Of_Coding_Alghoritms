# Research_Of_Coding_Alghoritms

This repository contains the project “Research of Coding Algorithms” within the subject Linear Algebra. The three of us worked on it, me, Roman Zaletskyi, and Maksym Kutsenko.

The methods we implemented: Huffman coding, BCH, LRC, and the convolution method.

The results of these encodings are presented in the file Report.pdf.
